# Polar Book Shop -- Kotlin Versin

Welcome to the Polar Book Shop repository, rewritten entirely in Kotlin!

The Polar Book Shop project was originally designed and demonstrated by **Thomas Vitale** in his book *Cloud Native Spring in Action*. This repository serves as a Kotlin-based adaptation of the original codebase, offering a practical example of using Spring Boot with Kotlin for modern cloud-native applications.

## Why This Project?

If youâ€™re transitioning from Java to Kotlin, this repository can serve as a helpful reference. It illustrates how Kotlin can enhance your productivity and code quality while maintaining compatibility with the Spring Boot ecosystem.
